# War Card Game

Experience the thrilling classic card game War brought to life in Python through the power of object-oriented programming. I created this project in Jupyter Notebook, which encapsulates strategic gameplay, with each card meticulously crafted as an object. Immerse yourself in epic battles and dynamic strategy, all within the digital realm.

I created this project while learning the concepts of OOPs in Python.
